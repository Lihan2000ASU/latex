\section{Introduction}

For documentation see \texttt{texdoc ltsockets-doc} for now.

\section{Extended cross-referencing of document properties}

Traditionally \LaTeX{} allowed with \cs{label} to record two \enquote{local} 
properties of the document: the representation of the current page number and 
of the current counter. Their values could then be referenced with the 
(non-expandable)  commands \cs{ref} and \cs{pageref} in arbitrary places of a 
document.  With the summer 2023 release the \cs{label} was enhanced to record 
also if set by packages like \pkg{nameref} or \pkg{hyperref} the title and 
the name of the link target. 

Over the years packages extended the label-ref system in various ways. 
Examples are for example the \pkg{refcount} package to reference the values 
expandably, the \pkg{smartref} package, which allows to store more counter 
values and so to reference the current chapter together with the current 
equation, the \pkg{cleveref} package, which stores in a second internal label 
beside other the name of the counter,  the \pkg{hyperref} package whose 
\cs{autoref} command tries to retrieve the name of the counter from the name 
of the link target, the \pkg{tikzmarks} which records absolute positions on 
the page, and the \pkg{zref} package which implements a general method to 
record and reference properties. 

Starting with this release the \LaTeX{} kernel contains now its own 
extension. It is loosely based on \pkg{zref}. It allows to declare new 
properties, to record arbitrary combinations of properties. The values are 
retrieved expandably. 

As an example to setup a new property which records the current chapter 
number the following declaration could be used: 
\begin{verbatim}
\NewProperty{chapter}{now}{?}{\thechapter}
\end{verbatim}
The second argument means that the property is recorded immediately 
(\enquote{now}) and not at shipout. The third argument sets a default if a 
label is unknown. It is then possible to record a list of properties with 
\cs{RecordProperties}: 
\begin{verbatim}
\RecordProperties{mylabel}{chapter,page,currentlabel}
\end{verbatim}
To reference the value the \cs{RefProperty} command is provided which takes 
two arguments, the label and the property: 
\begin{verbatim}
\RefProperty{mylabel}{chapter}
\end{verbatim}
 
The new module predeclares a set of generally useful properties: 
\texttt{currentlabel} (the standard counter representation), \texttt{page} 
(the page representation), \texttt{title} (the title if set e.g.~by 
\pkg{nameref}), \texttt{target} (the name of the link target if set e.g.~by 
\pkg{hyperref}), \texttt{pagenum} (the page as an arabic number), 
\texttt{abspage} (the absolute page number), \texttt{counter} (the name of 
the current counter), \texttt{xpos} and \texttt{ypos} the position on the 
page as set by a previous \cs{pdfsavepos}. 
  
The module provides both \LaTeXe{} camel case commands and expl3 commands.    

For documentation see \texttt{texdoc ltproperties-doc}. 

\section{New or improved commands}

\subsection{Provide counter representations for link targets}

To create unique link targets the package 
\pkg{hyperref} needs special counter representations
\verb+\theH+\meta{counter}. For this it patches the 
commands \verb+\@definecounter+, \verb+\@addtoreset+ 
and \verb+\refstepcounter+. These counter representations are also
needed for the tagged PDF project and so these patches have now been incorporated
into the kernel.

\section{\emph{Removed} commands}

It is very rare that commands are removed from the \LaTeX{} kernel. However, in
this release we have elected to remove \cs{GetDocumentCommandArgSpec},
\cs{GetDocumentEnvironmentArgSpec}, \cs{ShowDocumentCommandArgSpec} and
\cs{ShowDocumentEnvironmentArgSpec} from the kernel. These commands have been
moved back to the \enquote{stub} \pkg{xparse} provided in \pkg{l3packages}. The
reason for this change is that the commands were essentially part of debugging
early forms of the kernel code, and expose implementation detail in a way that
was not helpful.

\section{Code improvements}

\subsection{Support for tabs in \cs{verb*} and \texttt{verbatim*}}

\LaTeX{} converts a single tab to a single space, which is then treated like a
\enquote{real} space in typesetting. The same has been true to date inside
\cs{verb}, but was done in a way that meant that they remained as normal spaces
even in \cs{verb*}, etc. We have now adjusted the code so that tabs are
retained within the argument to \cs{verb} and \cs{verb*}, and the
\texttt{verbatim} and \texttt{verbatim*} environments independently from
spaces, and are set up to print in the same way spaces do. This means that they
now generate visible spaces inside \cs{verb*} and \texttt{verbatim*}, and their
behavior can be adjusted if required to be different from that of spaces.
