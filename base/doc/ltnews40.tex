\section{Switch to T1 as default encoding in documents using \cs{DocumentMetadata}}

As it is well known the font encoding OT1 supports only 128 characters and has various problems and quirks notably for languages different to english. Nevertheless OT1 is the default encoding in \LaTeX{} and this can not be easily changed without affecting many documents as the T1 version of the fonts have slightly different metrics. 

The introduction of the \cs{DocumentMetadata} command, which announces \emph{new} code
and changes that can also affect the layout gives us now the opportunity to make this step. So with this version a use of \cs{DocumentMetadata} with (pdf)\LaTeX{} will setup  T1 as default font encoding\footnote{The Unicode engines will continue to use TU as encoding.}. To ensure that scalable fonts are used, the package \pkg{cm-super} has to be installed. Users that want to revert to the OT1 encoding in their document can do this \verb+\usepackage[OT1]{fontenc}+.

\section{Handling paragraph continuation}

Already \LaTeX~2.09 offered some automatism to detect whether or not
text after a list or some other display environment is meant to be a
continuation of the current paragraph or should start a new one.  The
document-level syntax for this is that a blank line after such an
environment signals to \LaTeX{} that it should start a new paragraph; whilst
no blank line signals that there should be no new paragraph and the
text should be considered a continuation.

Unfortunately, there are a number of cases where the original 2.09
approach failed, e.g., with
\begin{flushleft}
  \ttfamily
\{\meta{local customizations}\\
\cs{begin}\{equation\} a<b \cs{end}\{equation\}\} \\
\meta{some text}
\end{flushleft}
the \meta{some text} incorrectly started a new paragraph.  Bug reports
about this behavior can be traced back to the time \LaTeXe{} was
developed, e.g., one test file from 1992 has a note that the above
case was unfortunately not resolvable despite some improvements made back
then.  The main cause of the issue (as you probably guessed) is that
the mechanism failed whenever the environment was executed within a
group (\texttt{\{...\}}, \cs{begingroup}/\cs{endgroup}, or
\cs{bgroup}/\cs{egroup} pair) that was closed before the next blank
line was reached.

While most of the time  this could be visually corrected by adding some
explicit \cs{noindent}, the situation got worse when we tried to
implement tagged PDFs resulting in incorrect structures or worse.

We therefore made a new attempt to resolve this problem in every
situation and this new solution is rolled out in the current
release.

\section{Code improvements}

\subsection{Avoiding keyval option clashes between classes and packages}

In \LaTeX{} News~35~\cite{40:ltnews35} we introduced keyval option processing
to the kernel. Following the standard for \LaTeXe{} options, keyval options
given to the \cs{documentclass} line were treated as global and so parsed by
every package. However, with keyvals, the likelihood of a name clash between a
class-specific option and one used by a package is much higher than it is with
simple strings. We have therefore refined the mechanism in the current release.

When a class uses the kernel keyval processor, any options it recognises are
recorded and any packages using the keyval processor will then \emph{skip}
these \enquote{global} options. To allow for the case where a class directly
uses an option which should be global (for example \texttt{draft}), a new key
property \texttt{.pass-to-packages} has been added. This can then be set to
indicate that this key is not to be skipped. For example
\begin{verbatim}
\DeclareKeys{
  draft .if = {ifl@cls@draft},
  draft .pass-to-packages = true,
  mode  .store = \cls@mode
}
\end{verbatim}
in a class would create two options, \texttt{draft} and \texttt{mode}. The
\texttt{draft} option will be treated in the normal way by packages using
keyvals, but they will ignore the \texttt{mode} option: it is effectively
marked as \enquote{private} to the class.

\section{Bug fixes}

\subsection{Fix wrong file type in a rollback warning}

When \LaTeX{} is rolled back to date \meta{date1} and a class or
package with minimum date requirement \meta{date2} is to be loaded, a
rollback warning is raised if \meta{date2} is later than \meta{date1}:
\begin{verbatim}
LaTeX Warning: Suspicious rollback/min-date date given
               A minimal date of YYYY-MM-DD has been specified for package
               '<pkgname>'.
               But this is in conflict with a rollback request to YYYY-MM-DD.
\end{verbatim}

In some cases this message showed a wrong file type, i.e.,
\verb|document class '<pkgname>'| or \verb|package '<clsname>'|.
This has now been corrected.

\githubissue{870}

\subsection*{Fix existence check of document environments}
\cs{NewDocumentEnvironment} and friends define (or redefine) a document
environment using the space-trimmed \meta{envname}, but the existence
check for \meta{envname} was done without space trimming. Thus when the
user-specified \meta{envname} consists of leading and/or trailing
space(s), it may lead to erroneously silent environment declaration.
For example, in
\begin{verbatim}
  \NewDocumentEnvironment{myenv}{}{begin}{end}
  \NewDocumentEnvironment{ myenv }{}{begin}{end}
\end{verbatim}
the first line defines a new environment \env{myenv} but the second
line would check existence for \env{ myenv } (which is not yet defined),
then redefine \env{myenv} environment without raising any errors.
This has now been corrected.

\githubissue{1399}

\subsection{\pkg{doc}:\ \cs{PrintDescribeMacro} in preamble}

In \pkg{doc} version 2 it was possible alter the definition of
\cs{PrintDescribeMacro} and similar commands in preamble. In version 3
this stopped working because they go reset at the end of the
preamble. This has now been implemented differently and changes in the
preamble are possible again.

\githubissue{1000}


\section{Improvement to \XeTeX\ \cs{showhyphens}}
When using \cs{showhyphens} with \XeTeX, missing character warnings
would be generated for any character not in Latin Modern. This has been
corrected and the warnings are suppressed.
%
\githubissue{1380}

\section{Avoid code duplication in rollback}

When the kernel uses \cs{AddToHook} in a region that might be 
rolled back (which happens in a few places) and a document requests a
rollback, then we have the situation that the hook already contains code to which we added the same
(or slightly different) code during the
rollback; this results in code duplication or, worse, in errors. This has
now been corrected by dropping any such code chunk (if there is one) prior to
adding the rollback code.

\subsection{\pkg{longtable}: Extend caption type}

The \pkg{longtable} has been extended and now provides the command \cs{LTcaptype}
(stemming from the \pkg{ltcaption} package) to change
the counter and caption type used by the \cs{caption} command from longtable.
So with \verb+\renewcommand\LTcaptype{figure}+, a longtable will step the
figure counter instead of the table counter and produce an
entry in the list of figures. An empty definition, \verb+\renewcommand\LTcaptype{}+,
will suppress increasing of the counter. This makes it easy to define an
unnumbered variant of longtable:
\begin{verbatim}
\newenvironment{longtable*}
  {\renewcommand\LTcaptype{}\longtable}
  {\endlongtable}
\end{verbatim}
